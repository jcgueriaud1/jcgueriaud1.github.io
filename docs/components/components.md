# How to integrate a JavaScript library in Vaadin 14+

Vaadin gives you the possibility to create a web application only with Java. That's great but sometimes you need to extend the design system with new components. You have different solutions to extend or create a new component, from the simplest to the hardest:
* You can use different Java components. You don't need to use any JavaScript, it's easy to maintain and the [official documentation](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/creating-components/tutorial-component-composite.html) is quite good.
* You can use an existing web component. The [official documentation](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/web-components/integrating-a-web-component.html) is also great. But there is nothing that help you to choose the right library.
* You can use a Javascript library and use it.
* You can build your own component.
